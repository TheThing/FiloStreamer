## About

FiloStreamer is a simple GUI application frontend on top of ffmpeg, designed to simplify and ease configuring and setting up local live stream from a [Blackmagic](http://blackmagicdesign.com/) [Decklink card](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink) source.

It was mostly designed for [FÃ­ladelfia](http://filadelfia.is/is/) services but it's open source for anyone who wants to fiddle with the code or having similar setup.

## Features

Currently, FiloStreamer is designed to solve these problems:

* Broadcasting a video stream to the local network (udp)
* Record same video stream to file (mp4, h264)

All this while providing a simple UI and overview of the encodings and its status. The code is also designed to be flexible as well as simple but also reliable.

## Future

I'm hoping to expand the features in the future to make [Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html) a thing of the past (those that have used it know what I'm talking about.)
